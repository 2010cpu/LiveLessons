This directory contains all the Project Reactor source code examples
from my webinars on [Modern Java by
Example](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/MJBE).  Here's an
overview of what's included:

. ex1 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously using a wide range of features in the Reactor
        framework, including flatMap(), collectList(), zipWith(),
        first(), when(), and onErrorResume().
  
. ex2 - This example is currently just a placeholder for random things
        I'm playing around with for Project Reactor.  It's likely to
        change radically from time to time.
