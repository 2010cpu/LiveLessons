This folder contains source code for a command-line app that
reimplements the
[SearchTaskGang](https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/LiveLessons/tree/master/SearchTaskGang)
example from my [Java
Concurrency](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/LiveLessons/CPiJava/)
LiveLessons tutorial using Java 8 features, such as lambdas, method
references, Streams, and CompletableFutures.  This app focuses on
comparing/contrasting the performance of different concurrency models
based on Parallel Streams and CompletableFutures.
