This folder contains source code for an app that reimplements the
[SearchTaskGang](https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/LiveLessons/tree/master/SearchTaskGang)
example from my [Java
Concurrency](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/LiveLessons/CPiJava/)
LiveLessons tutorial using Java 8 features, such as lambdas, method
references, Streams, and CompletableFutures.  This command-line app
focuses on comparing/contrasting the performance of different
concurrency models based on Parallel Streams and CompletableFutures.
