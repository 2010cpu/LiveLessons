This directory contains Java 8 source code examples from my [immersive
courses at
Vanderbilt](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/courses.html) and
my Live Training courses.  Here's an overview of what's included:

. Async -- This example shows the use of the Java 8 streams to process
  entries in a recursively structured directory folder concurrently
  using the Java 8 completable futures framework.

. ForkJoin -- This example shows how to use the Java fork-join pool
  framework and Java 8 sequential streams to count the number of files
  in a large recursive folder hierarchy, as well as calculate the
  cumulative sizes of all the files.

. Sync -- This example shows the use of the Java 8 sequential and
  parallel streams framework to process entries in a recursively
  structured directory folder sequentially and in parallel.
