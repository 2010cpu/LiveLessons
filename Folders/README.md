This directory contains Java source code examples from my [immersive
courses at
Vanderbilt](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/courses.html) and
my Live Training courses.  Here's an overview of what's included:

. Async -- This example shows how to use the Java completable futures
  and sequential streams framework together with the Visitor pattern
  to process entries in a large recursive directory folder.

. ForkJoin -- This example shows how to use the Java fork-join pool
  and Java sequential streams frameworks to count the number of files
  in a large recursive folder hierarchy, as well as calculate the
  cumulative sizes of all the files.

. Reactor -- This example shows the use of the Reactor to process
  entries in a recursively-structured directory folder sequentially
  and concurrently.

. RxJava -- This example shows the use of RxJava to process entries in
  a recursively-structured directory folder sequentially and
  concurrently.

. Sync -- This example shows how to use the Java streams framework
  together with the Visitor pattern to process entries in a large
  recursive directory folder sequentially and in parallel.
